During this lab we have seen how Sysdig Monitor provides deep visibility into your containerized infrastructure and out of the box allows to:

- Explore the containerized infrastructure from a point of view of Cluster operator.
- Use Prometheus formatted metrics in Sysdig Monitor.
- Monitor the state of your Kubernetes cluster using key metrics and monitoring approaches:
  - Golden signals applied to Kubernetes internal components.
  - Troubleshoot if there are some performance problems in Kubernetes master node.
- Monitor the state of the different software components that Kubernetes uses.
- Learn some internals about how Kubernetes works.
